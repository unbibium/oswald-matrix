Not much time I'm already late to bring this to HeatSync Labs.

when you build it, load it into x64 and type something like

`SYS 49152,999,3`

the second number is the number of iterations before it quits
the third number is the picture number (0 through 3)

You can display large text on the screen, up to 10 characters, like this:

`SYS 50000,"HEADLINE",4`

the number at the end is the starting X position of the cursor.
