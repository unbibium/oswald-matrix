;
; Screen Headliner was originally a program from Compute!'s 
; Gazette, which allows you to draw PETSCII characters at four 
; times the regular size, using the PETSCII quadrant characters.
;
; This version has the following improvements:
;  * More compact so that the PETSCII quadrant table can be
;    stored contiguously -- the original version required
;    an extra READ loop.
;  * Controls the cursor position and RVS state by manipulating
;    the OS variables instead of outputting control codes.
;  * Can print against the right edge of the screen without
;    breaking up the character.
